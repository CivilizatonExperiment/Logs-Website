# Logs-Website
Website to visually view mysql logs.

We're trying to make a logs website that will have few pages with wrapped querys.

# Parts to do.
There will be a few key parts to this system,

1) We need a user system, this will need to be a solid thing (perhaps google sso? to make it secure). But then I will need to be able to give different permissions to different users (so we need a human readable list (emails are fine bonus points for letting me add nicknames)).

2) Standardized log pages (just want them to look uniform).

3) Log pages to look up every info in each table as defined in this [repo](https://github.com/CivilizatonExperiment/CivExLogging/tree/master/src/com/civexperiment/CivExLogging/Database/Tables "CivExLogging/Database/Tables/") (These will change as needed).

4) *fluff* be able to add notes to each log (maybe you click on it and its a drop down? and only admin can delete these notes, each user can see who posted the note)

# Ref

This picture is of a previous version that I've had just for refrence, (i know its ugly but it worked)
